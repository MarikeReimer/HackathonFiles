# HackthonFiles
 
This repository contains files and data associated with a neuron that was traced in Tilt Brush.  The rendering was split into diferent .obj files for each mesh created, which are stored in the Object Models folder.

The Rawdata folder contains a .txt file showing the data organization from soma.obj.

HackonthonScript.ipynb reads the .obj data and contains example data to use for ROI and image segmentation.
